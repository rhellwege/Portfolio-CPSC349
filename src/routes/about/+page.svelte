    <p>
        I am a 22 year old fourth year computer science university student from
        California. I started programming as a hobby in 7th grade when I taught
        myself javascript using P5.js to create small games. Since then, I have
        gone gotten an associates of computer science from Saddleback Community
        College and am currently enrolled in California State University
        Fullerton. Other than programming, I enjoy playing piano and enjoying
        music through listening and writing.

        Beyond classwork, I participate in CSUF's ACM club by contributing to
        the Open Source Software group's projects. I helped work on the design
        gallery page for the club's website at <a
